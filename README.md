============

ThenomicaBot is the loyal moderator bot of [/r/TheNomic](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheNomic).

Right now, he does the following:

* Ballots [Prop] threads within 30 seconds.
* Posts [Check-In] threads every Monday and Thursday at midnight EST.
* Detects and invalidates edited proposals.

In the future, we hope he will take on the following duties:

* Update the idle players list based on check-ins.
* Keep the location directory up-to-date.
* Count votes and update posts (and the rules?) accordingly.
